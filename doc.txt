Installation & Run

Install Dependencies:

pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy passlib[bcrypt] pyjwt python-multipart pydantic[email]


Setup Email (Optional for Verification):
In main.py, update SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS with your credentials to enable real email sending.

Start Backend:

python main.py


Serve Frontend:
Since the frontend is index.html, and the backend handles routing/static files, you can simply open the app at http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI handles CORS automatically).

Log in as user1.

Click the + icon, type user2, and start a chat.

Open another tab/browser, log in as user2.
